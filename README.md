# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various projects completed during Machine Learning classes. Each folder represents a distinct project focusing on specific aspects or techniques of machine learning. Below is an overview of the folder structure and contents.

## Folder Structure

### `imbalanced_dataset`
This folder contains a project focused on handling imbalanced datasets. The project explores techniques to address class imbalance, such as resampling methods and performance evaluation metrics tailored for imbalanced data.

### `decision_tree`
A project dedicated to decision tree algorithms. It includes implementation, tuning, and evaluation of decision trees for classification tasks.

### `knn_logisticregression`
This folder covers a project involving k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Logistic Regression algorithms. It includes comparative analysis and applications of both methods to solve specific problems.
